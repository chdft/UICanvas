# About UICanvas

## Why?
I created this application, because I had quite some trouble showing users (= people who are no developers) how an app will roughly look and behave *before* actually implementing the UI. I guessed, that an application to visualize the behaviour would either take a long time to develop or be hard to use, so I decided to start this project and work on it for one day and see how usable the result was.

## Further Development
As soon as there is VS15 with support for Windows 10 Universal Apps (and Windows 10), I will try to convert/rewrite this desktop application. Until then, there probably won't be many milestones. But if you have ideas, you are very welcome to implement them and create pull-requests.
